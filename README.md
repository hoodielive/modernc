Modern C

### Start at the bottom, not the top.

- Closest to metal - Full access to system resources, memory management, etc (more than any other language on the same OS).

- Lowest level you can go before ASM and still be cross-platform.

- You can still write an entire game in C, although many professionals use C++:
    OpenGL pure C API
    SDL pure C API (Steam)

- Learn C, transfer skills to almost every other programming language.
